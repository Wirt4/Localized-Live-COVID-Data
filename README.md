# Localized-Live-COVID-Data
A down-and-dirty COVID Dashboard. The objective is to make something in Jupyter that's as portable as possible without wasting extra time with builds and hosting.

Github and mybinder are great, but they don't support all the interactive wigets and graphically intensive tools that you can use with Jupyter locally.
 
Right now this is defaulted to Santa Barbara, CA. However I designed this to be sharable. Clone the repo, switch out the names in the header and the constants in cell #2 and you have your own local COVID data dashboard. To better communicate the results, entering the repo address at mybinder.org will make a less intimidating looking web app that should be sharable on social media.
